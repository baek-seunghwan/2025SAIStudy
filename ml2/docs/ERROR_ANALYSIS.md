# ERROR ANALYSIS (Template)

## 1) Fold-wise Performance
- Report macro F1 per fold; inspect variance & leakage risks.

## 2) Threshold Sensitivity
- Plot precision/recall vs threshold; pick stable region near LB optimum.

## 3) Segment Analysis
- Error by segment (month, channel, region, income bins, etc.).
